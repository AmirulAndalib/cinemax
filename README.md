### üîê Replacing API keys

You need to use your own TMDB, Opensubtitles and Mixpanel API keys. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and create fields TMDB_API_KEY, MIXPANEL_API_KEY and OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY and assign a value to them with your own keys.

Mixpanel is used for general analytics thus can be removed, same goes for opensutitles but TMDB API key is necessary.

API keys can be found at:
https://developer.themoviedb.org/v3/reference/intro/authentication#api-key-quick-start

https://mixpanel.com

https://www.opensubtitles.com/consumers

### üï∑Ô∏è Using self-hosted scraper instances

This repo uses the [Consumet API](https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org) and [FlixQuest API](https://github.com/BeamlakAschalew/flixquest-api) to scrape streaming links of movies and TV shows.<br>You need to have your own instance running on free services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Render](https://render.com)

In the .env file you created (follow the above "Replacing API keys" section if you don't have an .env file), add `FLIXQUEST_API_URL` and `CONSUMET_URL` fields and add your FlixQuest API and Consumet API instances respectively.

After that your env file should look like this:
```env
TMDB_API_KEY="your_tmdb_api_key"
MIXPANEL_API_KEY="your_mixpanel_api_key"
OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY="your_opensubtitles_api_key"
CONSUMET_URL="https://your-consumet-instance.someserver.com/"
FLIXQUEST_API_URL="https://your-flixquest-api-instance.someserver.com/"
```

### üî• Firebase dependencies

The repo uses Firebase remote config to update different URL's and general values that needs to be updated dynamically without updating the app. You can remove the code if you want static values for some of the fields. 

This repo also uses Firebase Database to store data of registered users and to sync bookmarks between SQLite and well, you guessed it Firestore Database. You can also remove this code, it'll work just fine.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Adding custom better_player package

This repo uses customized better_player package which can be found at github.com/beamlakaschalew/flixquest-betterplayer

Clone the repo to your machine and edit the location of the better_player package that is found in the project's pubspec.yaml to wherever the package is located.<br>
Also alternatively you can just use the git url like so:
```yaml
better_player:
    git:
        url: https://github.com/BeamlakAschalew/flixquest-betterplayer.git
```
